TravelSDK API for Android
===============================
TravelSDK is a software development kit, supported by PERENNIAL UG & Co. KG., 
that allows for creation of travel applications. It includes JSON+REST web services and APIs, 
which enable developers to integrate travel services into existing or brand new applications.

With the TravelSDK Android API, you can add travel services to your mobile application. 
The API automatically handles access to TravelSDK servers and data downloading. 
The API allows you to search for and book flights, hotels, car rentals and excursions. 
It builds on the TravelSDK REST+JSON services and simplifies the complexity of service requests and parsing and mapping of returned data.
